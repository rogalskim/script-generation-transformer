    "## Build the Neural Network\n",
    "Implement an RNN using PyTorch's [Module class](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html#torch.nn.Module). You may choose to use a GRU or an LSTM. To complete the RNN, you'll have to implement the following functions for the class:\n",
    " - `__init__` - The initialize function. \n",
    " - `init_hidden` - The initialization function for an LSTM/GRU hidden state\n",
    " - `forward` - Forward propagation function.\n",
    " \n",
    "The initialize function should create the layers of the neural network and save them to the class. The forward propagation function will use these layers to run forward propagation and generate an output and a hidden state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The output of this model should be the *last* batch of word scores** after a complete sequence has been processed. That is, for each input sequence of words, we only want to output the word scores for a single, most likely, next word.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure to stack the outputs of the lstm to pass to your fully-connected layer, you can do this with `lstm_output = lstm_output.contiguous().view(-1, self.hidden_dim)`\n",
    "2. You can get the last batch of word scores by shaping the output of the final, fully-connected layer like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# reshape into (batch_size, seq_length, output_size)\n",
    "output = output.view(batch_size, -1, self.output_size)\n",

    "**Answer:** \n",
    "- With the first training session, I wanted to check if the training process will complete  without errors, so I chose hyperparameter values that would have low computational cost. The exact values were chosen arbitrarily, mainly based on previous projects:\n",

    "sequence len.:  10\\\n",

    "epoch count:     1\\\n",

    "embedding dim.: 100\\\n",
    "hidden dim.:    128\\\n",
    "LSTM layers:    2\n",
    "- The network went form the initial loss of 6.00 down to about 4.50, so the training algorithm seemed to be working as intended. The hyperparameters obviously required tuning to reach the goal of 3.5 loss, though.\n",
    "- First, I increased the step count to 100, hoping that this will enable the network to \"see\" more relationships between words in these wider temporal windows. Loss was around 4.55 after 1-st epoch and 4.25 after 4-th. So there wasn't actually much of an improvement. So I took a different approach: I calculated the mean and median for non-empty words in a line, and got 8 and 11, respectively. Based on this finding I tested sequence lengths of 8, 10 and 12, during short, 1-epoch sessions. It turned out that the initial value of 10 was producing the best results.\n",
    "- Then, I tested several batch sizes (24, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400). I was hoping that smaller batches would result in more frequent weight optimization steps and faster convergence. However, the effect was opposite: the additional computational cost was slowing the process heavily and it took way too long. Ultimately, I noticed I can get away with a batch size of 300 without incurring any significant increase of training loss while speeding up training a lot.\n",
    "- I did some testing of several learning rate values but generally got bad results each time, so finally I settled with the standard (for Adam optimizer) 0.001 LR.\n",
    "- From the earlier lessons and other sources, I knew that 2 or 3 LSTM layers are usually enough for these types of problems. I compared two models, having the same number of units, but distributed to 2 or 3 layers. The difference in the final loss value was small, but the 3-layer architecture did seem to have slightly better accuracy.\n",
    "- The two parameters that turned out to have the greatest impact on training loss, were the total number of LSTM units and the embedding dimension. This makes sense – the larger the embedding vector, the more input features are visible to the network. It can then learn more relationships and patterns. And the more units, the more “capacity” for learning it has. I tested embedding values from 100 to 2048 and unit counts of up to 3072. Best results were achieved for models having a large embedding dim AND many LSTM units, but the training times were very long. Other combinations (e.g. small embedding, many units) were not so successful, but faster. Embedding dims of around 512 with around 3 times as many total LSTM units proved to provide a good compromise between accuracy and training time. For the final run, I settled for embedding dim of 1024, 896 units/layer with 3 layers (so 2688 units in total). After 12 epochs, this model reached a final loss of 3.41. "
